    <h1>Ruskie Pierogi</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Filliing:</h3>
    <li>15oz farmer's cheese</li>
    <li>7 potatoes, peeled and boiled</li>
    <li>3tbs vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2.5 cups mushrooms, peeled and sliced</li>
    <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
    <li>1tbs sour cream</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <li>8 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>6tbs unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
    <h2>Directions0</h2>
    <li>Step 1:
        <p>Pass farmer's cheese and cooked potatoes separately through a food grinder or food processor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Step 2:
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook mushrooms and onions until soft, about 15min. Remove from heat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Step 3:
        <p>Combine farmer's cheese, potatoes, mushroom mixture, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix together and set filling aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Step 4:
        <p>Place flour on a clean work surface and make a well in the center. Crack both eggs into the well. Add butter and few tablespoons of the warm water. Mix with your hands, gradually adding more warm water, 1tbs at a time, as you go. Knead well, continuing to add more water as needed. Knead until dough is soft and smooth, adding more flour to the work surface as needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Step 5:
        <p>Cut off 1/4 of the dough and roll out to a thickness of 1/8 of an inch. Cut out circles using a glass or a round pastry cutter, saving the excess dough for your next batch.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Step 6:
        <p>Fill each dough circle with 1 tsp of filling. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and pinch edges together to seal. Cover with a clean dish towel so pierogi won't dry out and repeat with remaining dough and filling.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Step 7:
        <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add the pierogi in batches, about 20 at a time, and cook until they float to the surface, 10 to 15min. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain in a strainer. Repeat with the remaining pierogi.</p>
